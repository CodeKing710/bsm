Usage: bsm [OPTIONS] ...

Options:
    -c | --create [NAME] [OPTIONS]
	    Add new script(s) to your personal scripts. Specify a file extension to use a specific scripting language. Bash is default and doesn't require a file extension. You may also specify the script type by following this argument with '-p', '-n', '-r', or '-l'. Please note that even though those arguments exist outside '-c', using them here changes their meaning.
	    Available: .js (-n), .py (-p), .rb (-r), .cl (-l), .pl (-e), .ps1 (-P)

    -l | --list
	    Show list of available personal scripts

    -o | --open [NAME]
	    Open a script for editing (ONLY PERSONAL SCRIPTS LOCATED AT /scripts).
